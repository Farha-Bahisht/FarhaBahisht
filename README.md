## 🚀 About Me

🔧 I build apps that *work* — and work well. With hands-on experience developing Android apps, backend systems, and accessible smart tech, I'm all about creating inclusive, scalable, and human-centered software.

✨ I recently worked on a **Smartwatch App for the Visually Impaired**, blending AI, accessibility design, and real-time data to create something truly meaningful. I also contributed to the **MyHealth App** at Wexner Medical Center, helping patients connect with their care through secure and user-friendly mobile solutions.
